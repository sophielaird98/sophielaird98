- Hi, Iâ€™m @sophielaird98 ðŸ‘‹
- An analytic and creative, Software Development Masters student based in Belfast
- Coming from a fashion design background, I am currently challenging myself in a transition course, learning everything from computing foundations to coding and databases. I am specialising in Java, however, am keen to develop a vast knowledge of other computer coding languages outside of my course requirements.
- My GitHub will be used to demonstrate the skills I am learning throughout my modules in my masters and develop real world scenarios to solve using code.
